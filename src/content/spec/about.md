# About
Belfar Dev is a one-person, indie, possibly pretentious, game development studio. A lot of titles for such a small thing, I know.

## How it started
> There once was a young man with a dream of creating a game. 

I was going to say "The year was 2015", but actually it goes way back. Around 2005, with [RPG Maker XP](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp), but don't ask me what I was aiming for, it's been 20 years - or more, depending on when you're reading this.

Ever since, I remember having the urge to create a game of sorts. I designed it all: 3D procedural generated persistent world with great freedom of movement and infinite building/crafting, a mix of [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) and [SimTower](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTower), recreating already existing games like chess and card games, and, of course, the [MMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game) of my dreams.

But the paper accepts everything, as well as the lonely nights spent tinkering with various ideas to get nowhere.

## Why are we here?

The very existence of this blog quenches two needs of mine: writing and developing games.

The first one is trivial to explain. A blog can't exist without words, and I like to write them one after another - a little too much to get lost in thought, sometimes. 

"But you can make a game without a blog", I hear you say. And you'd be correct, if I didn't lack the discipline and the belief that a game could be launched entirely by me. That's a strategy that some content creators adopt: journal their process to create a sense of responsibility with their audience, building up a social pressure of sorts to keep on going.

Along with my fondness of writing, I believe this is worth a shot.

Before I ask you to read the entries, I have to say that the creation of this blog would be procrastinated to God knows when if it weren't for a friend of mine to encourage me to finally do it.

> Thank you, I hope you have fun reading each entry, even though I don't have a newsletter as of now.

Now you can go, thanks for reading a bit about me and my dream.
